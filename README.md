# Penguin Colony Swarm
This is our final project for EECE 7065 â€“ Complex Systems and Networks.
We are simulating the social thermodynamic emergent behavior in penguin
colonies.

# Liu's Prototype Branch

A minimal setup to test an idea about "blind temp-sensing-only" penguin colony. It did poor job on swarming unfortunately. 

`blind_pen_proto.py` is the implementation of the idea. Running it as main generates plots in the current directory.

`simulate.py` incorporates the above code, and converts the plots into a gif `animation.gif`.
