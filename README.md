# Penguin Colony Swarm
This is our final project for EECE 7065 â€“ Complex Systems and Networks.
We are simulating the social thermodynamic emergent behavior in penguin
colonies.

# Usage
There is a conda environment with all dependencies called `src/environment.yml`.
See [managing conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
With the environment activated, you can run the main simulation from the `src/` directory with:
`python main.py cfg/template.ini`

For full usage, see:
`python main.py -h`

You may edit the simulation configuration in the `cfg/template.ini`, which has each parameter documented.
I would recommend copying `cfg/template.ini` and editing the copy, then passing the copy to `src/main.py`.

The simulation will make a directory named after the template file to store the images generated by the simulation.
For example, `src/cfg/template.ini` will store the images in `img/template`.
